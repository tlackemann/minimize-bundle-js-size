# Minimizing Bundle Size

By simply referencing file paths instead of destructing `import` statements, we
can significantly cut back on bundled JavaScript. This is extremely useful for
creating lean Single Page Applications and can applied to most node libraries.

## Usage

If you want to test the bundles (each runs the same basic examples), you can use:

```
npm start
```
